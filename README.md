This repository demonstrates a common error when using Kotlin's collection processing functions.  The `sum()` function, when used directly on a list of integers, works as expected. However, when the list is created by a transformation such as `map`, unexpected behavior may occur, especially if the transformation involves types other than simple integers. The example showcases how the `sumOf` function should be used to avoid this potential issue.
